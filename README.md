# hello-world
My first test repository

My name is Filipe and I'm from Brazil. I graduated from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Management. Even from the undergraduation School I always liked technology, but now I have decided to spend more time on it.

I already have skills in Excel, Tableau, VBA, Data Structure and Data Visualization, and now I want to enhance my toolskit with Python (numpy and django), SQL, and Web langagues (HTML, JavaScript and CSS) so that I may deliver a better job at my work, and help to create solutions that help people in general, in all the spheres, Work, Social and Religious.

And my desire in work is to do what Paul said in Colossians 3:23:

"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men". To God be all the glory and honor!
